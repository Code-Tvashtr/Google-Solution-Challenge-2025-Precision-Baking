### Step 1: Understand and Define the Problem
Goal: Convert vague recipe measurements (e.g., cups, spoons) into precise weights (grams) for accurate baking.
Subtasks:
Identify key features to implement (ingredient database, conversion logic, user interface).
Outline measurable success criteria (accuracy, usability, coverage of common baking ingredients).
Tools Required:

Project Management Tools: Trello, Jira, or Notion to organize tasks and track progress.
Documentation: Google Docs or Notion for team collaboration and requirement specifications.
### Step 2: Research and Data Collection
Task:
Gather densities of common baking ingredients (e.g., flour, sugar, butter).
Compile unit conversion standards (e.g., 1 cup = 240 mL for liquids).
Handle variations in ingredients (e.g., sifted vs. unsifted flour).
Approach:

Use reliable sources like USDA Food Database, ingredient-specific websites, or professional baking resources.
Structure the data into a table with columns for Ingredient Name, Density (g/mL), and Type (solid, liquid).
Tools Required:

Data Sources: USDA Food Database, WolframAlpha, or trusted recipe websites.
Spreadsheet Tools: Google Sheets or Excel for data organization.
Database for Later Use: SQLite or Firebase for storing and querying the ingredient database.
### Step 3: Design the Architecture
Task:
Plan how the system components (database, conversion algorithms, and user interface) will interact.
Create a modular design:
Backend: Ingredient database and conversion logic.
Frontend: User interface for input/output.
AI Component: Recipe parsing and ambiguity handling.
Approach:

Draw a system architecture diagram (e.g., using Lucidchart or Miro).
Define APIs for ingredient lookup and conversion.
Tools Required:

Diagram Tools: Lucidchart, Miro, or Figma.
Tech Stack: Python/Django or Node.js/Express for backend; React.js for frontend.
Database: MySQL or Firebase for ingredient storage.
### Step 4: Develop the Database
Task:
Build a database schema to store ingredient densities and conversion standards.
Include fields like Ingredient_Name, Density_g_per_ml, and Notes.
Approach:

Start with a CSV or JSON file to test the data structure.
Implement the database using SQL (e.g., MySQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB).
Tools Required:

Database Tools: MySQL, SQLite, or MongoDB for storage.
Scripting Tools: Python (Pandas) for data manipulation and loading.
### Step 5: Develop Conversion Algorithms
Task:
Write logic to convert volume measurements (cups, spoons) into grams using the ingredient density.
Handle cases for liquids vs. solids.
Formula:

Weight (g)
=
Volume (mL)
×
Density (g/mL)
Weight (g)=Volume (mL)×Density (g/mL)
Approach:

Implement conversion functions in Python or JavaScript.
Consider edge cases, such as packed vs. loose measurements.
Tools Required:

Programming Languages: Python (NumPy, SciPy) or JavaScript.
Testing Tools: Pytest or Jest for validating algorithms.
### Step 6: Build the User Interface
Task:
Design a simple interface for users to input recipes and get converted measurements.
Allow manual adjustments (e.g., for custom densities).
Approach:

Use React.js or Vue.js for a responsive frontend.
Include features like:
Input fields for recipe text.
Real-time display of converted measurements.
Option to save custom ingredient densities.
Tools Required:

Frontend Frameworks: React.js, Vue.js, or Angular.
UI Design Tools: Figma or Adobe XD.
CSS Frameworks: TailwindCSS or Bootstrap.
### Step 7: Implement AI for Recipe Parsing
Task:
Use NLP (Natural Language Processing) to extract and interpret measurements and ingredients from recipe text.
Approach:

Train an NLP model to:
Identify ingredients and measurements (e.g., "1 cup flour").
Recognize variations (e.g., "2 heaping tablespoons").
Use libraries like SpaCy or Hugging Face Transformers.
Tools Required:

NLP Libraries: SpaCy, NLTK, or Hugging Face.
Dataset for Training: Custom dataset of recipes or open datasets like Recipe1M.
### Step 8: Test and Validate
Task:
Verify the accuracy of conversions and usability of the interface.
Test recipe parsing on real-world examples.
Approach:

Conduct unit testing for algorithms.
Perform usability testing with bakers or target users.
Collect feedback and iterate.
Tools Required:

Testing Frameworks: Pytest, Selenium (for UI testing).
User Feedback Tools: Google Forms or usability testing platforms like Maze.
### Step 9: Optimize and Iterate
Task:
Improve performance, scalability, and user experience.
Add stretch features like recipe scaling or voice input.
Approach:

Profile and optimize code for speed (e.g., with Python’s cProfile).
Add internationalization for metric/imperial units.
Tools Required:

Optimization Tools: Profilers like PyCharm or Chrome DevTools.
Localization Tools: i18next or react-intl.
### Step 10: Deployment and Presentation
Task:
Deploy the solution on a public platform.
Showcase the app’s functionality and benefits.
Approach:

Host the app on cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, or Vercel).
Create a live demo for the hackathon presentation.
Tools Required:

Hosting Platforms: AWS, Heroku, or Vercel.
Presentation Tools: Canva or PowerPoint for demo slides.
